The Dart SDK has the libraries and command-line tools that you need to develop
Dart apps. To learn about other tools you can use for Dart development, see
[Dart Tools](/tools).

<aside class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
  **Note:** This site's documentation and examples use
  {% if site.data.pkg-vers.SDK.channel == 'dev' %} the **dev channel** {% endif -%}
  version [{{site.data.pkg-vers.SDK.vers}}][site SDK version]{:.no-automatic-external}
  of the **Dart SDK**.
</aside>

## Install the SDK {#install}

As the following instructions show,
you can use a package manager
to easily install and update the Dart SDK.
Alternatively, you can
[build the SDK from source][] or
[download the SDK as a zip file](/tools/sdk/archive).
{% comment %}
NOTE to editors: Keep the zip file link as the last thing in the paragraph,
so it's easy to find (but not more tempting than package managers).
{% endcomment %}

<aside class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
  {% if site.data.pkg-vers.SDK.channel == 'dev' -%}
  **Important:**
  The **Dart 2** SDK is available from the **dev channel** only.
  {% endif %}

## What's in the SDK

The Dart SDK includes a `lib` directory for the [Dart libraries][] and a `bin`
directory that has these command-line tools:

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-lg-6" markdown="1">
  [dart]({{site.dartlang}}/dart-vm)
  : The standalone VM

  [dart2js]({{site.webdev}}/tools/dart2js)
  : The Dart-to-JavaScript compiler (used only for web development)

  [dartanalyzer](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/tree/master/pkg/analyzer_cli#dartanalyzer)
  : The static analyzer

  [dartdevc]({{site.webdev}}/tools/dartdevc)
  : The Dart development compiler
  (used only for web development)
  </div><div class="col-lg-6" markdown="1">
  [dartdoc](https://github.com/dart-lang/dartdoc#dartdoc)
  : The API documentation generator

  [dartfmt](https://github.com/dart-lang/dart_style#readme)
  : The Dart code formatter

  [pub]({{site.dartlang}}/tools/pub)
  : The Dart package manager
  </div>
</div>

For more information about the SDK, see its
[README file.](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/master/README.dart-sdk)

## About release channels and version strings

The Dart SDK has two release channels:

* **stable** channel: **stable releases**,
  updated no more frequently than every 6 weeks;
  currently `[calculating]`{:.editor-build-rev-stable}.
* **dev** channel: **pre-releases**, usually updated 1/week;
  currently `[calculating]`{:.editor-build-rev-dev}.

<aside class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
  **Warning:**
  To give you early access to new features and fixes,
  dev channel releases are not as heavily tested as the stable release.
</aside>


**Stable** channel releases of the Dart SDK have version strings like `1.24.3` and `2.0.0`.
They consist of dot-separated integers, with no hyphens or letters.

**Dev** channel releases of the Dart SDK (pre-releases)
have additional characters, starting with a hyphen (`-`).
For example, Dart 2 pre-releases have version numbers starting with
`2.0.0-dev` such as `2.0.0-dev.69.5`.
